# Walking Patterns Analysis Based on Weather Conditions  

This project analyzes walking data obtained from the Apple Health app and correlates it with historical weather data. The goal is to explore how weather conditions influence walking habits and identify potential trends or patterns.  

## Research Question  
**How do different weather conditions, such as temperature influence walking behavior and habits?**  

## Motivation  
Walking is a fundamental activity for maintaining physical and mental health. However, external factors like weather can significantly impact walking routines. By understanding these influences, we can:  
- Promote healthier lifestyles by encouraging consistent walking habits.  
- Offer recommendations for optimal times to walk based on weather conditions.  
- Help urban planners design infrastructure that supports walking in varying climates.  

### Objectives  
- Extract and process walking data from the Apple Health app.  
- Combine walking data with weather datasets for the corresponding time and location.  
- Perform data analysis to identify correlations and trends.  
- Visualize the impact of weather conditions on walking behavior.  

## Data Sources  
1. **Apple Health Walking Data**: Exported as an XML file containing detailed walking statistics.  
2. **Weather Data**: Historical weather data sourced from public APIs or datasets.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python**: For data processing, analysis, and visualization.  
  - Libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `requests`.  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: To perform interactive data analysis.  
- **GitHub**: For version control and collaboration.
