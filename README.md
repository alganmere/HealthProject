# Walking Patterns Analysis Based on Weather Conditions

This project analyzes walking data obtained from the Apple Health app and correlates it with historical weather data. The goal is to explore how weather conditions influence walking habits and identify potential trends or patterns.

## Project Description  
Walking is an essential part of our daily physical activity. By analyzing walking data under various weather conditions, this project aims to provide insights into how factors like temperature  affect on walking behavior.

### Objectives  
- Extract and process walking data from the Apple Health app.  
- Combine walking data with weather datasets for the corresponding time and location.  
- Perform data analysis to identify correlations and trends.  
- Visualize the impact of weather conditions on walking behavior.

## Data Sources  
1. **Apple Health Walking Data**: Exported as an XML file containing detailed walking statistics.  
2. **Weather Data**: Historical weather data sourced from public APIs or datasets   

## Technologies Used  
- **Python**: For data processing, analysis, and visualization.  
  - Libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `requests`.  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: To perform interactive data analysis.  
- **GitHub**: For version control and collaboration.
